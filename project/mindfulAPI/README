Will have to install mongodb and create a mindfuldb database in order to get started.



# database
Run mongod
To set up database run db_script.js or copy contents of db_script.js into mongo shell

# backend
Start node server with npm init start -- might have to create new node project because I couldn't copy my npm file over.

## db.js
sets up connection with database. is called from server.js

schema example:
  email: "joebruin@ucla.edu", 
  first_name: "joe", 
  last_name: "bruin", 
  limits: {"facebook": 30, "reddit": 40, "twitter":30},
  mode: "study",
  timeout_pref: 100,
  counter: {
      "facebook": 10,
      "reddit": 5,
      "twitter": 0
    }
NOTE: limits and counter are JSON objects

## server.js -- all the apis are here

GET list
  -- created for testing purposes, simply lists all of the users in our database
  -- query params: None
 
GET getUser
  -- retrieves all information pertaining to a user using their email id
  -- query params: email
  -- this should be called to load the user data into our ui
  -- response: email, first_name, last_name, limits, mode, timeout_pref, counter

POST newUser
  -- adds new user to the database
  -- query params: email, first_name, last_name, limits, mode, timeout_pref, counter
  -- should be called if we want to show that we can create a new user

POST updateLimits
  -- update the user-defined screen time limits for each website
  -- query params: email, limits
  -- NOTE: we must update the whole limits json object (not the limit for a single website)

POST updateCounter
  -- update screentimes for each website
  -- should be called when a user leaves a particular website (ends session on that site)
  -- query params: email, counter
  -- NOTE: we must update the whole counter json object (not the counter for a single website)
